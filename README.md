# Widgets-App-with-React

## Overview
This Widgets App is compliled with accordion display, dropdown display, wikipedia API, and Google translator API that utalized three different hooks in React such as useState, useEffect, and useRef to communicates between the data structures of this App. In additional, a navigation menu bar was built from scratch by using pushState and PopStateEvent so that I have a better understanding about the logics and routing methods behind the scene.

## Components
### Accordion- Accordion.js
Accordion style display was implemented through prop and useState. To show active item when clicked, a const object which returns the word 'active' are being used at each item's content during the mapping process of redering.

### Wikipedia Search API- Search.js


### Dropdown- Dropdown.js

### Google Translator API- Translate.js, Convert,js

### Navigation and Router- header.js, Link.js, Route.js
